## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [1. I would like to add "to give a 2 chance to user when the
the user made wrong in their first try"
2. And instead the user play with computer it is better to play with another user like him/her.
Which basically the game play by two players] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
[I used this two website and some YouTube video as well.
a.https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_settime.asp
b. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
[The challenging one that I had encountered in creating this submission was function making sound. Since I was new to web development
 I hadn't done anything like this. So I had a hard time understanding how the sound system was working.
 I spent more my hours in the  specific function playtone and the stoptone to understand how it was working.
 It was also very difficult to understand the  frequency map though.
 But always what I believe is challenging work makes you explore, research and read many books.
 As result I saw some you tube video how the frequency was work and I read some in google, and as I mentioned a website in the above
 I found it really helpful. It was helping me with a lot of things that I hadn't known before.
 At last I got a great concept in the function of the making sound system. As a result I added one other sound frequency.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
[1. I had many questions about web development after I was done with my submission.
Which what I was realized that most of the time
most web development was done by CSS, html, Javascript, and others like Ruby as well.
But why don't use C++ or c languages? Why those  are not popular
to use as web development, which only we use  for the back-end only?
2. And also what kind of testing and quality control checks do you perform
prior to the launch of a new website?
3. Since I was new to web development and this is my first project in web development,
so how should I develop my web development skill and how should I start to develop it?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
[If I had time, I would like to add some of the features like adding a ticking  clock.
Because when I was looking on that it seem really trick full, And I believe it was
testing my abilities of understanding and my logic thinking.
I will definitely do it when I get time. Also the "the spruce by buttons"
also looks fun to do it. I wish I could do all the features but in the matter of time i didn't do it all the features.
I did only one feature, so I guarantee you to add some features when I got time to do it.
